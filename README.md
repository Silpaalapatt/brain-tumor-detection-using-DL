# brain-tumor-detection-using-DL
This repository contains a deep learning project for the detection of brain tumors in medical images. Deep learning techniques are employed to create a model that can effectively identify the presence of tumors in brain scans.

Steps
1. Importing Libraries
In this initial step, essential Python libraries for deep learning and image processing are imported. Libraries such as TensorFlow, Keras, and OpenCV are typically used to build and train the deep learning model.

2. Importing Dataset
The dataset containing brain images is loaded. This dataset consists of MRI or CT scans that include both tumor and non-tumor images. These images are crucial for training and testing the deep learning model.

3. DL Model Creation
The deep learning model is constructed using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). The model typically includes the following layers:

Convolutional Layers: These layers apply filters to detect various features within the input images.

Pooling Layers: Pooling layers reduce the dimensionality of the feature maps, making the model more efficient.

Hidden Layers: Fully connected hidden layers are included for feature extraction and decision making.

Output Layer: The output layer provides the final decision or prediction regarding the presence of a brain tumor.

4. Performance Evaluation
The model's performance is evaluated using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC curves. Additionally, the confusion matrix is analyzed to assess the model's ability to correctly classify brain tumor images.

The results obtained from this deep learning project can be instrumental in assisting medical professionals in diagnosing brain tumors from medical images. Early detection and accurate classification of tumors can significantly improve patient outcomes and healthcare processes.
